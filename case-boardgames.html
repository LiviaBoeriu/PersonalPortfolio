                    People in Aalborg that have a small social group and wish to play board games with others have a hard time finding peers for this. 
                    Their solution is to either write on facebook groups or by going to board game cafes and using physical signs to signal they are open for others to join. Neither method,
                    as revealed by our research, showed to be highly effective.

                For this project we choose to have a medium degree of user involvement, 
                with users being included both in the early stage of development and also in the following phases.  <br><br>
                By analyzing the number of team members involved, the prospect of changing requirements and main goal of the project we chose to adopt an agile approach.
                Due to the nature of the project we have also chosen to have this
                in combination with a plan-driven approach, seeing as we were in an academic context that prompted us to have thorough documentation of the process. <br><br>
                During the development period we have worked in two-week sprints consisting of planning, reviewing and retrospective. 
                In order to manage possible uncertainties as 
                well as identify risk factors we initially carried out a series of risk management activities 
                which resulted in a risk mitigation, monitoring and management plan.

            <h5 id="survey-boardgames" class="case-subheading">Survey</h5>
            <div class="case-paragraph">
                The initial research steps were aimed at getting an overview of the problem. We started by conducting a survey with the purpose
                of gaining insight into the real need of our target group.
                This method was chosen due to the need of gathering a large amount of responses from potential users, while also collecting general knowledge about 
                the usersâ€™ needs and demographic data in order to better determine the demographic aspect of this group. The survey was carried out in Danish, as the system itself 
                would be released in a Danish context and was conducted online for a fast reach over a short period of time. <br><br>
                The survey was divided into two sections, the first one aimed at finding general thoughts in regard to finding other players for board game activities 
                and a second one where the respondents were presented with a short description of a system idea following a series of inquiries about it. 
                The survey had a total of 575 respondents with 54% of them being males and 45% females with a majority of respondents situated between 18-37 years old. <br><br>
                The results from the survey revealed that 60% of respondents faced difficulties at some point in finding other people to play board games with. 
                This confirmed our initial presumption that there is indeed a need for creating a tool to ease these difficulties. Related to this finding it was 
                also revealed that genre or specific games also had an influence in the degree of difficulty of finding other players. 
                After being presented with our idea of having a web instrument for finding board game players, more than half of the respondents answered they would be
                interested in using it.

            <h5 id="interviews-boardgames" class="case-subheading">Interviews</h5>
            <div class="case-paragraph">
                The survey was followed by  a series of semi-structured interviews with 8 board game players in order to obtain in-depth knowledge on how 
                the players engage in this activity. The motivation behind choosing to also carry out interviews was to gain deeper insight into what the respondents
                opinions were, in contrast to the survey which benefited us on a quantitative level, but allowed only for pre-planned inquiries and short open ended questions. 
                By choosing semi-structured interviews we also looked for more specific data, while also leaving room for additional 
                topics to be discussed. One of the interviews was carried out with the owner of a board game cafe we collaborated with. This was done in order to also grasp 
                the perspective of someone who is an actor on the board game scene on a daily basis. The interviews were subsequently transcribed and color coded, following a 
                guide the group agreed upon, consisting of four different themes: characteristics, behavior, problems and needs. <br><br>

                The interview with the owner revealed that the cafe offers a physical sign for people to show they are in need of additional players, 
                but this brings up social problems, where a person might feel intimidated by having to be so straightforward in approaching a large 
                group that they want to join. This is also not very effective seeing as at the cafe people usually already come in groups, rather than alone. 
                There is also a physical board set up for matching people but this has the same shortcoming as the sign, people rarely go to these cafes by themselves. <br><br>

                From the interviews with our other informants we found out that one of the reasons they engage in this activity is the social aspect,
                which weighs more than other motivations. This usually takes place at board game cafes where the atmosphere plays a big role in creating nice environment.
                The main medium through which people usually search for additional players are Facebook groups which do not provide all the
                desired features needed for searching and creating meetups in this regard. From this it was clear that there was a need for a more custom experience that
                would allow for the introduction of additional elements such as choosing a specific game, provide a calendar for multiple meetups, and categorizing information.

            <div class="case-paragraph">
                After gaining a better understanding of the users needs and the overall context we moved to the design stage. 
                We developed a PACT analysis based on Benyons (2014) description and further elaborated on the initial requirements for the system using the MoSCow rules.
                Additionally, we generated use cases that aim to cover activities that should happen in the application domain for several features of the system such 
                as match profiles and meetup creation. <br>
            </div>

            <div class="case-paragraph">
                After this stage, we proceed with the design of the prototypes. We started off with a rapid prototyping session in order to explore ideas for design,
                key functionally and navigational patterns. This resulted in a lo-fi prototype from each team member. These paper prototypes were sketched individually 
                in order to avoid influencing each other. Their evaluation consisted of finding commonalities in each of the lo-fi prototypes and discussing 
                advantages and disadvantages for their potential inclusion in the system. Following this we combined the elements decided upon during our discussion 
                in a final lo-fi prototype consisting of the most essential pages of the system: landing page, main page, profile, matchmaking and meetup. <br><br>
                
                The lo-fi prototype was evaluated with our domain expert, the owner of the board game cafe. We chose him to conduct this evaluation seeing as he 
                had experience in managing board game activities and creating meetups in this sense. The results from the evaluation indicated that the overall design
                was appropriate with the added suggestion on focusing more on showing users preferences in games in the player profile. 
                It was also noted that the matchmaking and meetup functions have the potential to serve the board game community well.

            <div class="case-paragraph">
                After this evaluation we proceeded in creating a hi-fi prototype that encompassed all of the findings. This was created using Axure RP 9 and 
                focused on also integrating functional elements. The prototype was evaluated in two stages. First, we carried out an internal heuristic evaluation,
                in accordance with the ten usability heuristics presented by Nielsen (1994). The results from this indicated that the meetup and matchmaking pages did not have 
                appropriate levels of help and feedback, which was solved by providing additional information features. In addition, improvements were also made on the consistency
                of the visual design and elements for better navigation were added. <br><br>
                
                This was followed by a user evaluation. During this stage the participants were given a 
                set of four tasks that had to be performe on the prototype by using a think-aloud method to vocalize their thoughts. After finishing the tasks 
                we asked the participants to fill out a semantic differential questionnaire followed by a short debriefing. 
                After contacting 19 potential users, we carried out a total of 5 user evaluations.
                These tests revealed that the content of the prototype was intuitive and easily understandable. 
                However, there were some aspects that caused difficulties such as the participants having a hard time identifying the games and genres from the drop-down menus. 
                Some participants mentioned that they would prefer to have the option of writing in-game options themselves as a list of all games that exist would be 
                overwhelming to navigate through. A finding that stood out was the preference of having the option to select between new and experienced players. 
                The results from the semantic differential scale indicate that the participants found the prototype to be relevant, original and useful. <br><br>
                
                After the evaluation of the prototype we moved onto the implementation phase. For this we used C# and followed the Model-View-Controller pattern with Microsoft
                SQL Server for database management.

                One of the main challenges during this project was represented by the short-time span for completiong the project.
                This made the technical implementation more difficult along with trying to learn a new coding language. <br><br>
                Another aspect that raised difficulties was the fact that we tried combining two different methodologies, agile and plan-driven.
                This was due to the fact that even though the main process were supposed to follow agile methods, we had to also focus on thoroughly documenting the activities and 
                planning the process in a rigid manner.

                The main outcome of the project revealed a need for a system that focused on people that have a hard time finding peers
                to engage in board game activities with. Through our prototyping activities we inched closer to coming up with a solution for this problem, 
                which as a next step should be implemented in a more thorough way and evaluated again in a series of user tests.
