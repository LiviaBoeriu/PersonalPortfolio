            <div class="case-paragraph">Technology has become a common thing to have in our lives, and lately it seems to
                further separate us
                rather than help us get closer, even though we are able to connect more easily with each other.
                Well-being seems to be decreasing
                as it can be seen from the high number of reports concerning our mental health.
            </div>

            <h3 id="approach-thiscloser" class="case-heading">Approach</h3>
            <div class="case-paragraph">Even though we have been able to communicate from the beginning of mankind,
                with the introduction of technology we seem to have become increasingly unskilled in doing this.
                This is the reasons why we took on this project and started looking at current information on this
                topic. We found that self-disclosure
                might be an appropriate tool to use in this situation and so we choose to combine this with technology:
                <b>voice-user interfaces</b>.
            </div>

            <h5 id="research-thiscloser" class="case-subheading">Research</h5>
            <div class="case-paragraph">
                In the beginning of this study we had little experience and information regarding the design of
                voice-user interfaces.
                We therefore set on to expand our knowledge and find out more about how to utilize self-disclosure in
                order to increase well-being in people.
                The first steps we took were focused on creating an exploratory study environment. Here, we had 18
                participants that helped us uncover valuable information.
                The study was planned in a controlled environment, as for this phase, we wanted to filter out external
                factors that might have influenced our results.

                The participants came in pairs and <b>interacted with each other by having a smart assistant facilitated
                conversation</b>.
                During each session, two participants came into the room and interacted with each other by answering a
                series of 25 questions posed by the device.

            <div class="case-paragraph">
                Before and after the activity they were asked to fill out an IOS scale which helped us measure whether
                their perceived closeness would suffer any modifications.
                The sessions were followed by semi-structured interviews to get the participants thoughts on the
                interaction and create a complete image of the activity.

            <h5 id="findings-thiscloser" class="case-subheading">Findings</h5>
            <div class="case-paragraph">
                The findings showed that for groups that were formed out of strangers there was a greater increase in
                closeness,
                according to the results from the IOS scale. This scale however provided us with inconclusive results in
                regards to the participants that
                had a more intimate relationship, seeing as most pairs already checked the highest level in closeness
                prior to the session.

                However, these groups revealed during the interview that <b>the session had a positive impact</b> and it made
                them
                relieve memories and reflect on their relationship.
                The results from this initial exploratory observation indicated that the smart assistant could prove to
                be a good facilitator of interaction in face-to-face
                interactions, but further research was needed.
            </div>

            <h5 id="design-thiscloser" class="case-subheading">Design</h5>
            <div class="case-paragraph">
                Following this exploratory stage, we moved to a more specific area of research.
                This decision arose from previously gathered data. Smart devices are mostly present in homes, and as
                several statistics showed couples were among the majority of the owners.
                This information helped us find out the group that would benefit most from using this: romantic partners
                living together. <br><br>
                
                During this phase we also stepped away from the user-centered approach
                that, followed in the previous stage, to participatory design seeing as we were moving the study into
                private homes and we wanted to create a relaxed environment.
                Now the participants also became our partners and through their participation they also accumulated
                knowledge and shared a sense of responsibility regarding the outcome.
                We divided the stage into two parts: <b>deploying a smart assistant application</b> for self-dislcosure
                into the participant's homes,
                and <b>a digital design workshop</b>. <br> <br>

                At this moment we placed ourselves in a <b>”designing for users”</b> phase where the aim was to provide the
                participants with knowledge on
                the capabilities of smart assistants and
                allow them to gather experiences that they would reflect upon in a later stage. The deployment period
                lasted one month because <b>only a long-term
                study could uncover behavioural changes</b>. During this period we carried out three interviews with each
                pair and maintened close contact with them throughout.
                We chose interviews as the main data gathering method as this was minimally intrusive compared to observations, seeing as we were already
                invading the participant’s private space.

            </div>

            <div class="case-paragraph">
                We designed a technology probe, in the form of a smart device application, which was divided into three
                modules, each with a different purpose,
                and open enough so that the participants could use it how they saw fit. <br><br>
                The first module was created to <b>facilitate conversation</b> with the purpose of providing the participants
                with topics for conversation.
                This was similar to the way in which we developed the initial exploratory study, where it was revealed
                that this was a good way of enabling self-disclosure. <br><br>
                The second module took the form of a rudimentary game where the participants were encouraged to
                self-disclosure in a more lightweight manner.
                After the exploratory stage, where for some of the session we introduced game-like elements in the
                interaction, we decided we should further explore whether
                self-disclosure would be more effective when masked by <b>activities in the form of entertainment</b>. <br><br>
                The last module was intended as a <b>memory board</b> where participants could vocally register their thoughts
                and relieve them at a later time.
                The purpose behind this was to explore whether an uncommon method would encourage participants to
                self-disclose.

            <div class="case-paragraph">
                After the deployment period we moved on to a <b>“designing with users”</b> phase by doing a digital
                workshop with some of the pairs from
                the study in order to uncover possible design directions. For this we used “Make-Tell-Enact” activities (Sanders,
                2012) specific to participatory design.
                The main outcome of the workshop consisted of a series of collages made by each pair encompassing their
                vision for the design of an ideal voice-user interface for self-disclosure.

            <div class="case-paragraph">
                This marked the end of our collaboration with our participants and was followed by a thorough analysis of the gathered data in order to extract design guidelines.

            <h3 id="constraints-thiscloser" class="case-heading">Constraints</h3>
            <div class="case-paragraph">One of the main challenges we encountered became visible in the second part of the
                study where, due to global restrictions regarding COVID-19, we were unable to meet with the participants.
                We accommodated this by moving away from both face-to-face interviews and workshops, and planned the activities
                in a digital environment.
                On one hand this offered a more relaxed platform for carrying out the study, but on the other it created some difficulties for
                some of the activities from the workshop.
                We also encountered difficulties relating to our choice in platform, the Google Nest Mini.
                The “command-response” interaction created some usability issues, but at the same type provided a clear
                overview on what are the current
                development possibilities with the technology at hand.

            </div>

            <div class="case-paragraph">
                From our results it was made evident that there is an expectation that smart devices should also respond to non-verbal cues.
                The motivation behind using this type of technology should clearly be outlined or constructed through simpler goals, such as wining a
                game.
                What's more, in order to keep the users motivated and engaged,
                such applications should make use of IoT environments to become seemlesly included in the
                ecology of the home.
