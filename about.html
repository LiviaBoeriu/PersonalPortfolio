                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    Since I first got a desktop when I was little I became fascinated with the universe that exists inside computers. 
                    For a while I was too afraid to really follow my dreams and I tried pursuing a career in marketing. 
                    My true calling was always software and when I applied to Aalborg University at a master’s about IT Design and Application Development 
                    I finally took a leap of faith and started on my dream career path. Now that I am finally on this path I aim to create software that helps 
                    people while also taking on challenges that help me grow and test my limits. 
                </p>
                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    During my master’s I realized the perfect working environment for me involves interactions with other diverse minds.  
                    I am equally passionate about programming as I am about design and I believe good products come from simple and clear solutions.
                </p>

                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    My background in both the social sciences and software development allows me to understand users from a unique point of view. 
                    My work is guided by responsability and ethics, with emphasis on always enjoying the process and striving to achieve the best outcomes. 
                </p>
                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    When I am not working I love to try new things and constantly learn and improve. 
                    Most of the time I enjoy either watching a good movie. reading a captivating book or simply enjoying some video games. But I take my energy from meeting
                    with and interacting with others.
